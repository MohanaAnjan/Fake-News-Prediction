## Project Title: Fake News Prediction Using Machine Learning
### Project Description:
Developed a machine learning model to classify and predict fake news from legitimate news sources, leveraging advanced data analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and various machine learning algorithms.

### Key Responsibilities & Action Verbs:
* Collected and Preprocessed large datasets of news articles from multiple sources.
* Analyzed the data to identify key features such as word patterns, linguistic nuances, and context differences between fake and real news.
* Implemented machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to classify news articles.
* Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to enhance data preprocessing.
* Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve metrics to ensure high prediction accuracy.
* Collaborated with team members to fine-tune models and enhance overall system performance.
* Visualized results and key metrics using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to present insights to stakeholders.
* Deployed the model into a production environment using Flask API for real-time prediction.
